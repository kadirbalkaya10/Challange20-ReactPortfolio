          I'm on a mission to become a full-stack developer while diving into
          the fascinating worlds of machine learning and deep learning.
          Balancing work, education, and my personal goals might be tough, but
          I'm determined to make it work. If I can squeeze in a degree in
          engineering or physics while I'm at it, even better. My ultimate
          dream? Landing a spot at SpaceX. I truly believe in aiming high and
          dreaming bigâ€”there's so much more out there for us to explore and
          discover.
